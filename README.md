# 6-IOS-calculator

Here is my 6th project. I've made this IOS calculator by using HTML & CSS skills.
In this project, We have made this IOS calculator without backend side. So you can't do any calculation for now, but keep watching my projects. Because you will see this calculator work when I learn Javascript :)
I learned how to shape calculator with HTML and CSS codes and clone it as much as real IOS calculator.

As an engineer, I was familiar with IT world but this step was one of my life changing step. 
I'm beginning to a journey which I'm planning to be a perfect Software Developer.
Let's move on...
